In this file we'll look into few vim editor commands.


esc i   --> it converts the editor to insert mode. we can add the content/data.

esc :w  --> it writes the code, which is also called as saves the code/content/data.

esc:q  --> it helps to quit the vim editor.

esc:wq  --> this command helps to save and quit.

esc:wq!  --> quit forcefully

dd    --> deletes the line
5dd  --> deletes 5 lines

yy  --> yanking { copies the line of code/data}

p  --> pastes the line of code

set nu   --> sets the numbers in the editor
set nonu  --> removes the numbered lines in editor
